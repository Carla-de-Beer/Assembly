Linux 64-bit assembly language programs. 
There is still plenty of scope for optimising the performance of these programs, but they should serve as suitable 
examples for anyone setting out on learning how to program with assembly for x86-64 architectures. There are also examples calling assembly functions from within a C file, and examples of assembly code making use of C wrapper functions. A makefile is included for each program.
