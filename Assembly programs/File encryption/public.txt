This is an encryption system that reads in a given text file 
and then encrypts the data found inside the file by: 
  - reading in one byte at a time
  - rotating each byte left by 1 bit
  - incrementing the byte by one bit
  - repeating the process with each byte until the EOF is reached.

To decrypt an encrypted file, follow to process in reverse: 
  - read in one byte at a time
  - decrement the byte
  - rotate the byte right by one
  - repeat the process with each byte until the EOF is reached.

Execute the given C-file to generate the encrypted file.
